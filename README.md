# 2048++
TypeScript based implementation of the original [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) that is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun and to learn web in general and TypeScript in particular.

All business logic was completely rewritten and UI was borrowed from the original 2048. The logic was changed and the notion of levels was added.

**Now, you have a goal!**. For each you need to 'merge' stable tile and each time it would be harder and harder.
